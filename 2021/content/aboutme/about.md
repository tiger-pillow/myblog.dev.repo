Hi, 

I am Yiyuan. 

I am interested in evolutionry biology. I am a 1st-year master's student at [Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/fr/) since September 2021. 

I graduated from Yale College in 2021 where I majored in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. 

Talk to me about: snowboarding/skiing, guitar, trail running, [figure skating](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av80437018/), badminton. I code, take some photos and write a bit.
