Hi, 

I am Yiyuan. 

I am interested in good writings, good products, and commodity trading. 

I graduated from Yale College in 2021 where I majored in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. I obtained my master's at EPFL in Switzerland, studying computer science(?). Now I work in Geneva. 

An active life outdoors is a life worth living.
