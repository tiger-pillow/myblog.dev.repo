Hi, 

I am Yiyuan. 

I am interested in evolutionry biology, good writing of all genres, and computer science. I am a 1st-year master's student at [Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/fr/). 

I graduated from Yale College in 2021 where I majored in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. 

Things I do for fun: snowboarding/skiing, guitar, trail running, [figure skating](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av80437018/), badminton. 

An active life outdoors is a life worth living.
