Some content that have helped me tremendously in getting through Yale at tough times.

# Some quotes that I held dear to my heart 

#### on double major 
> "Hence the vogue for double majors. It isn’t enough anymore to take a bunch of electives in addition to your primary focus, to roam freely across the academic fields, making serendipitous connections and discoveries, the way that American higher education was designed ( uniquely, among the world’s systems) to allow you to do." -- *Excellent Sheep*

#### on finding a job
> “The paradox of potential”, Yale students, he said, are like stem cells. They can be anything in the world, so they  try to delay for as long as possible the moment when they have to become just one thing in particular. Possibility, paradoxically, becomes limitation. “My friends and I didn’t run sprinting down a thousand career paths, bound for all corners of the globe,” he wrote. “Instead, we moved cautiously, in groups, plodding down a few well-worn trails so as to ensure that two or four years down the road, we could be stem cells again, still undifferentiated, still brimming with potential.” -- *Excellent Sheep*

#### on college 
> College is a place to figure out: just what it is that’s worth wanting. -- *Excellent Sheep*



# Readings 
1. [Excellent Sheep](https://book4you.org/book/2381232/4e0273)  
    by William Deresiewicz, a former Yale professor.  
    His book is an easy and quick read. He truly pinpoints the mindset issue that most Yalies have and provide solutions to them. Would recommend when you start to question "what I am doing all this for?" 

2. [The Opposite of Loneliness](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2012/05/27/keegan-the-opposite-of-loneliness/)  
    by Marina Keegan ’12, who unfortunately passed away the weekend before commencement.  
    Her article best describes what it feels like to be at Yale, in its best moments. 

3. [On Self-Respect](https://www.vogue.com/article/joan-didion-self-respect-essay-1961)  
    by Joan Didion in 1961.  
    My friend Michelle forwarded me the article, and I loved it. What it means when you start to detach yourself from external validation and seeks strength from within. I had to read this many times due to the cultural references. 

4. [Paul Graham Essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)
    by Paul Graham, entreprenur, computer scientist, painter and venture capitalist.  
    This is my to-go material for procrastination. I love his clarity and depth. If you don't know where to start, click [here](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html). Even if it's written for high school, it's still quite relevant for college.
