The juicy part! Except mine isn't really juicy. 
# Friendships
   To be perfectly honest I had always struggled making friends or maintaining friendships, and especially at Yale. After four years, I have gotten to know some people (I am an acquitance with 5% of my class), and call maybe half a dozen people "friends", and have two people who I talk to frequently enough.

   I long for the kind of "I will always be there for you" friendship, as depicted in movies or books, the kind between Harry Ron and Hermione. But I have never been in one at Yale. I envy those who can just walk into the dining hall and have a dozen people they can sit with for lunch. I feel a bit sad when they always have some birthday party or formals to go to.

   I couldn't locate where the problem is. One reason might be that I am always busy. I always have something due, some quiz/exam to study for, and some experiments to be done in the lab. This is, of course, not just my situation, but most yalies' situation. Thus it takes a tremendous amount of luring (often with food) and repeated reminders to make sure people show up. 

   So it comes down to priority. Do I go support my friend's new theatre show or do I write some code for lab? Do I go for a run or do I listen to my friend complaining?
