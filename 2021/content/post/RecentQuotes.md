I sometimes find my words lacking the power, the forcefulness that my emotions carry, so out of laziness, I borrow others' words. These are some recent ones. 


### On dressing up for the male gaze (from Neapolitan Novels)
> In recent years I had begun to be interested in fashion, to educate my taste under Adele's guidance, and now I enjoyed dressing up. But sometimes -- especially when I had dressed not only to make a good impression in general but for a man -- preparing myself (this was the word) seemed to me to have something ridiculous about it. All that struggle, all that time spent camouflaging myself when I could be doing something else. The colors that suited me, the ones that didn't, the styles that made me look thinner, those that made me fatter, the cut that flattered me, the one that didn't. A lengthy, costly preparation. Reducing myself to a table set for the sexual appetite of the male, to a well-cooked dish to make his mouth water. And then the anguish of not succeeding, of not seeming pretty, of not managing to concel with skill the vulgarity of the flesh with its moods and odors and imperfections. But I had done it. I had done it also for Nino, recently. I had wanted to show him that I was different, that I had achieved a refinement of my own, that I was no longer the girl at Lila's wedding, the student at the party of Professor Galiani's children, and not even the inexperienced author of a single book, as I must have appeared in Milan. But now, enough. 

### On work 
> Everything is interesting if you know how to work on it 
Feymnman said something similar --- "almos everything is interesting if you go into it deeply enough" 

### On the value of listening and keeping a secret 
> Once I told her a secret*. I was afraid and I needed to tell someone the reason for my fear. I told her and she listened attentively, and I calmed down. It was important for me to talk to her, it seemed to me that she listened not with her ears but with an organ that she alone had and that made the words acceptable. At the end I didn't ask her, as one usually does: swear, please, not to betray me. But it's clear that if she hasn't told you** she hasn't told anyone, not even out of spite, not even in the period that was hardest for her, when my brother hated her and beated her.   
> "*" refers to the fact that the speaker is gay. "**" refers to the best friend of the secret guarder. 

### on how youth is wasted on the young 
> But at first chance it all started again. I fantasized, I listened at high volume to the music I had been ignorant of as a girl, I didn't read, I didn't write. And I felt increasingly regretful that, because of my self-discipline in everything, I had missed the joy of letting go that the women of my age, of the milieu I now lived in, made a show of having enjoyed and enjoying. 

### On men's desire to educate women 
> I thought about it for a moment, and continued: Maybe there's something mistaken in this desire men have to instruct us; I was young at the time, and I didn't realize that in his wish to transform me was the proof that he didn't like me as I was, he wanted me to be different, or, rather, he didn't want just a woman, he wanted the woman he imagined himself would be if he were a woman. For Franco, I said, I was an opportunity for him to expand into the feminine, to take possession of it: I constituted the proof of his omnipotence, the demonstration that he knew how to be not only a man in the right way but also a woman. And today when he no longer senses me as a part of himself, he feels betrayed. 

### On the role of language and who we are 
> It occured to me that it was now a linguistic question. She resorted to Italian as if to a barrier; I tried to push her toward dialect, our language of candor. But while her Italian was translated from dialect, my dialect was increasingly translated from Italian, and we both spoke a false langauge. 

### On life's elusiveness 
> Seeing how cheap and ugly they were (their childhood dolls) I felt confused. Unlike stories, real life, when it has passed, inclines toward obscurity, not clarity.
