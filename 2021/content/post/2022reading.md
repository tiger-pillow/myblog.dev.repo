How delightful are those fresh, untouched pages with enticing stories hidden in them! 

The pleasure of reading is multiplied during exam periods. Everything seems fun when compared to reviewing(alas how I started this blog!) So here I am, happy to be back with 2022's reading record. 

I like both fiction and non-fiction. Non-fiction is not immediately "useful",and thus it is looked-down by some of my more career-oriented acquitances. But it teaches us so much about life. Biographies and history are bounded by the limits of real events. The psychology of those characters are restrained to what they were willing to reveal in interviews (often not very much) and the author's guesswork. In other words, you never seem them as thoroughly as you can see a fictional character. 

Enough of my justification! Hope you will encounter good stories that inspires you too.


#### 1. Neapolitan Novels    by Elena Ferrante     5/5   

Wow what a masterpiece! It's my second time reading contemporary Italian novel, and now that I live quite close to Italy (a mere two-hour drive), the story pulls me even more. A powerful, realistic account of the entangled lives of two women -- class struggle, gender, poverty, violence, literature and academia, child rearing, men and sex, escaping the shadow of parents....this book has so much to offer. 

Interestingly, it's the time I find a female character whom I admire in a book -- I wish to have Lila's resilience, kindness, intelligence, righteousness, straightforwardness, despite the vicissitudes of life. She is not perfect, not a saint -- cantakerous, jealous, stubborn, manipulative -- but I don't aspire to be a saint either. I aspire to be someone with a strong character, who doesn't bend in front of the lures of money and power. I aspire to say "who gives a damn" without constantly doubting whether by not giving a damn, I have forgone a useful tie. 

I also talked to a friend into reading this with me, and I am so glad that she found the story interesting too. I can't wait to discuss this with her. So much to talk about -- meandering themes, symbolisms, decisions and transformations of characters. 


#### 2. From my life I write to you in your life by Yiyun Li 4.5/5 
Yiyun Li interests me in particular because she is Chinese, but she writes in English, her second language. She also has a master's in immunology(I was once a bio student), but now a creative writing professor at Princeton. 

Unlike many Asian writers, Yiyun Li lived in Beijing till she was 22, and her English is not perfect (I watched  her interviews on Youtube). Her parents don't speak English, and she refuses to have her books translated -- so her mother can't even read her work. 

I've wanted to read her fiction for a while now, but for some reason I have trouble reading dark stories and stories setup in China but told in English. I will try again. 

So I started with her autobiography, which I adore so far (I am about 2/3 in). She precisely reflects upon the questions that I have in mind ---- what's her relationship with Chinese and English? with her depression (she was hospitalized twice due to suicide attempts)? with the land of China? with the Chinese culture?  

I will write more when I finish it!
