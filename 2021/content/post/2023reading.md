### 1. The Escape Artist by Jonathan Freeland
Enticing story beautifully told, devoured it in three days. 

### 2. An Immense World by Ed 
Gave up half way through, gonna retry with a paperback (the pictures of animals mentioned are much needed!)

### 3. 欧洲文明十五讲 15 Lectures of European Civilization - 陈乐民
Lecture notes of Prof. Chen at Pekin Uni, very well written overview of European History

### 4. Tu peut-être en parler à quelqu'un par Lori Gottlier [Maybe You Should Talk to Someone]
Read the French translation of it, funny, interesting, wasn't convinced though. 

### 5. The Timetraveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger
I loved lvoed loved the prose style! so causal, detailed, yet organized, flowy and touching at the same time. Can't wait for the sequel! This books reminds me of why I love reading so much. Also best sex scene I've ever seen written. 

### 6. Divergente by Veronica Roth
A book series I've read in high school and now revisiting in French. Very well done young adult series (at least the first two books) -- lots of actions! perfect for learning French verbs. Beautiful sentences, conscise and powerful narrative. Fabulous translation! 

### 7. The Spy and the Traitor by Ben Macintyre
A book about one of the most successful spy in espionage history -- yet I find the details lacking.

### next? (oh I've a long list waiting...but hey if you have recommendations lmk!)
