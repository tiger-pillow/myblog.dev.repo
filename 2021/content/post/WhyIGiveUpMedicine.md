I've finally came to terms with my previous dream, and feel peaceful enough to answer this question. 

People who have known me for a long time know that for the longest time (more precisely, 21yrs + ), my dream was to become a doctor. As a kid, I read physiology encyclopedias. I was known as "the biology girl" in high school. I practically finished all pre-med courses at Yale with good grades. I've volunteered in hospitals, shadowed doctors and did medical research. I am even a certified EMT. Yet I didn't give this "one last push" to apply to medical school, but instead chose another path instead. 

I feel very happy now, and everyday I literally jump up from my bed to sit in front of my computer and start coding/writing/building. I am writing this article to give some explanation to friends who've asked me about this, as well as to straighten my own thoughts. 


## You can be anything you want, but......

We hear this so often -- from our parents, from Nike's ad banners, from inspiring documentaries and song lyrics. But as I get older, I feel like this sentence is always half-said. The full phrase is : 

####  "you can be anything you want, but not everything you want". 

For those lucky ones who want a simple life, this sentence doesn't hold. But for people who are ambitious, competitive, wants to get better on *all fronts* of life, this is unfortunately true. 

Time is limited. Energy is limited. A world-class violinist cannot be a world-class figure skater. A food youtuber with 10M subscribers cannot be a good AI researcher. 

I want to be world-class in *something*, but I can only be world-class in *ONE* thing, that is if I work really hard and I am lucky. 

For some reason, I came to this realization super late. I've always believed that if I just push myself harder, I can achieve everything that I want. So I had to face this difficult choice in the summer of 2020 -- should I continue my pre-med, or should I explore those other interests of mine? 

I cried a lot that summer. 

## Medical education system in the US

To explain why I cannot do BOTH, I need to talk about the US medical education system. 

In the U.S., you apply to medical schools after finishing a 4-year bachelor's degree. You go into this "pre-med" track, where you complete a series of necessary courses( biochemistry, organic chemistry, calculus , etc.), engage in volunteer services, perform medical research, take the famous MCAT (a 7-hour long grueling exam). After which, you apply to medical schools, and the application fee for each school averages to about 125$, and do interviews. If you get in, congratulations, the tuition alone is $67,484 per year (yale school of medicine 2023) * 4 years. Plus I am an international student on F-1 visa, which means the number schools that I can apply to is about 10% of the number for an American student.

## so why did I quit? 

I sound terribly bitter. I am not saying this is not possible. In fact, I know quite a few people who are incredibly tenacious, hard-working, and intelligent that they not only managed, but succeeded despite the difficulties.

But I am not one of them. Increasingly over the last two years at Yale, I felt that I was always playing "in the system". AAMC is a big system with clear rules on how to do well -- medical school, USMLE, matching, fellowship... paths are clearly drawn, preordained. It felt like k-12 becoming k-22. 

I was unhappy because I wanted to code, to start a business, to learn French, but these are not encouraged by the medical education system, especially for an international student. I've always had an entreprenurial urge in me -- to solve problems by coming up with new solutions. 

I was unhappy because I could not do both. Maybe I am not smart enough. Maybe I am not patient enough. I've always blamed my lack of abilities for giving up this dream. But increasingly I've realized that it's just not possible to **be good on all fronts**. 

So I chose to move to Switzerland, and become a builder, someone who writes, skier, runner, cyclist, francophone.....but not a doctor. I am not ready to delay gratification for forever. I work just as hard, and I want my gratification to guide me in my work. 

### another reason 
While shadowing at the Mayo Clinic, I had some problem resonating with patients, esp. when they are of a different race. I realized that my interests lie **more in the pathophysiology of diseases** and **less in the patient-doctor interaction**. Often I find myself reading wikipedia pages on [glioblastoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma), or [BRCA genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA_mutation), fascinated by the intricate mechanisms of the body. But never once I imagine myself being the person explaining the situation to the family, providing the comforting words so necessary in medicine. 

## That said, 
I still find medicine an incredible, invaluable domaine to devote a lifetime to. I still care about developments in the frontier of biomedicine, and still read up news about the newest cancer targets and immunotherapies. I think it's good that I quit -- the system is designed to weed out people who don't WANT IT enough (maybe a bit too harshly you may say), and my other interests pull me hard to other directions. I genuinely hope to see more breakthrough, and I don't regret taking all the biochemistry courses -- it give me an incredible foundation to understand, and that's gratifying enough for me.
