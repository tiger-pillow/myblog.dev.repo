>>"For a long time it seemed to me that life was about to begin, real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life. This perspective has helped me to see there is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way. So treasure every moment you have and remember that time waits for no one. Happiness is a journey, not a destination.” 很长一段时间，我以为生活马上要开始了，真正的生活。但是却总又有阻碍冒出来，又有问题需要解决，一些繁琐事物需要处理，一些债务要还清。直到有一天，我突然醒悟 ---- 这些障碍，就是我的生活。我意识到，这世界上并没有通往幸福的路。唯一的路是选择幸福。所以我开始珍惜每一个瞬间，因为时间不会等任何人。快乐的过好一生，而不是用一生去寻找快乐。  -- Alfred D. Souza
