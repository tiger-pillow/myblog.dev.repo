I often feel like this blog is a so **lame**, essays dry and uninteresting, reflections scattered and shallow. I feel embarrased putting it on instagram or linkedin, but I also desperately want people to read it and tell me what to improve. I shall persist, because there is no other way. 

> One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on where they don't seem very impressive, even to their creators. You have to push through this stage to reach the great work that lies beyond. But many people don't. Most people don't even reach the stage of making something they're embarrassed by, let alone continue past it. They're too frightened even to start. 

But I opened it up today in an attempt to write something. It's absolutely delightful to see the new section called "2022" rendered on this blog -- I have gone this far, why not just keep going at my own pace then?
