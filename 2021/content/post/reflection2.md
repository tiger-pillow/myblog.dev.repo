If you are interested in doing research at the undergraduate level, read on! I had many pitfalls to write this guide for you. 

# My experience with different labs 
Disclaimer: I have nothing bad to say about the following professors (except Van Tessel perhaps). My experience /time spent in each lab doesn't even qualify me to judge in most cases. I left because incompatibility and my own problems -- see reflections later on. This is just to situate you in my path.

1. Malhorta lab (radiology)
I worked very briefly in the Malhorta lab at Yale New Haven Hospital (Radiology department), introduced by an upperclass student that I know. My direct mentor was a resident (bad sign), and the research very clinical and mathy. Nobody has time to mentor me, and I did primarily data collection. Left after 1 year. 

2. Van Tessel lab (chemical engineering)
Here I saw the worst facets of a Yale professor. Paul Van Tessel is tenured, with no research funding, no grad student or staff, and an abanonded lab. I didn't know this when I emailed him and agreed to work for him. The first time I visited, there was a golden retriver tethered to the bench. Other professors and postdocs apparently used his lab as a storage room. Left after a semester. 

3. Kyriakides lab (biomedical engineering)
Awesome professor, great people. I worked under a postdoc, who tauhgt me something. Prof. Kyriakides was incredibly accessible and hands-on. We did experiments together and analyzed histology slides together. Didn't get any meaningful results. Left in the end due to my gap year. 

4. Lerman lab (nephrology, Mayo Clinic)
Worked there for a summer, great people and great lab, mentored by the great Dr.Kai Jiang. Published a paper. 

5. Wagner lab (EEB, yale)
I was referred to his lab by EEB DUS Prof. Stearns, and with him I took a class and completed my senior thesis. I was mentored by the PI himself, who is so kind and intelligent. I loved my project on the evolution of menstruation, loved it. 

# How labs work in the U.S.
As a high school student coming into college, especially a college like Yale with a plethora of labs and professors, you will be awed, confused, and ovewhelmed. It's important to get an idea of how labs operate in the U.S., which will help you in finding the appropriate starting place and ensure a good experience. Here, I speak from my personal experience and understanding, mostly in the field of biology. Other fields likely work very differently (for example, econ or math).

Each lab has a PI, principle investigator, who is the boss. The PI overlooks the operation and secures funding, which is argubly his or her most important task. Inside the lab, there are various posts similar to those of a food chain (not really): research scientists, post-docs, graduate students, lab technicians and managers, rotating students, undergraduates, and sometimes in the summer, high school students. A lab can be big as 50-80 people, or small of 2-3 people. Not all labs have all the positions, and the same position doesn't necessarily mean the same job. 

## Several different kinds of PIs, starting from the top: 
1. Emirtus professors / Fully tenured professors/ Professors with chaired titles.  
    These are fully tenured professors (tenure means they have this position for life, won't be fired unless they committed some serious wrongdoings). Sometimes you will see chair titles, such as "William Robertson Coe Professor of Ornithology". The chair titles usually means that they receive special fundings from the university, often donated by the namesake.  
    
    These professors often have quite established labs and have been at the university for years. They will often have continued fundings and served in various administrative positions (department chair, undergraduate director etc.)

2. Associate professors  
These are professors who have worked at the university for 3+ years, can be tenured or not. Sometimes they have chair titles too.

3. Assitant professors on the tenure track  
Often newly hired professors who just started their own labs. Usually, they worked as a postdoc in another institution for several years, published influential papers meanwhile and got hired. Univerisities will give them an initial funding (Yale usually gives 2 million or so) to start their own lab. They are the youngest in the department, and have to prove themselves in the next five years. At the end of their 5 year period, they will be evaluated by the tenured professors to determine if they can also be tenured or not. 
    
    They are often under considerable stress and work all the time.  

4. Teaching professors  
Professors who don't do research. For example, the [Gibbs professorship at Yale](https://math.yale.edu/about/employment). If there are not special endowment for them, they will be called lecturers. </ol>

## Other personnels: 
1. Research scientist  
    They are full-time researchers, who have done their PhDs but decide not to be a professor. They are very hand-on with experiments and specialize in certain parts of the research (such as computing, histology etc.) They sometimes lead their own projects, but mostly assist others. 

2. Technicians  
    People who support research projects, for example, by performing surgery on animals, operating the flow cytometery etc. You will likely talk to them often about how to debug an equipment or how to use another microscope. 

3. Lab Managers / Assistants  
    Responsible for many administrative stuff, such as billing, order of equipment and animals etc, scheduling lab meetings etc. 

4. Post-docs  
   People who just obtained their PhD from another institution, often doing significant amount of research and trying to publish. 

5. Graduate students / candidates  
   Graduate students are normally 1-2 year PhD students, who haven't passed their candidacy exam. Candidates are people who passed their candidate exam and start to work towards their thesis. 

6. Undegraduates  
    You! 

7. High School Students  
   Be careful, they mess up the pippets and contaiminate your cell cultures. 

# What you should be looking for in a lab  

1. Interest in the work  
    The most important thing. You have to be genuinely interested in the topic, the approach, the impact of the research. Don't just read the Scientific American report of the PI's research. Download the mesoteric paper and try to grind it through. 
2. Compatibile skills  
    If you know you don't want to slay mice, or you hate math, don't join labs that require those. However, sometimes you won't know until you've tried (me with wet lab work). That's okay, part of the process! 
3. Mentorship  
    Ideally, you will be in a lab working directly with a PI, a post doc or a research scientist who will meet you weekly. Yes, weekly meetings are required for any meaningful research. PhD students are not appropriate mentors. 

    Labs with good mentorship is hard to find. Sometimes you need to be lucky, but **more often you need to earn it yourself**. How? I will talk about it below. 

4. Proximity   
    This varies person to person, but certainly important to me. One of the lab I worked is was on Amistad street, literally on the other end of Yale campus. On a good day, it takes me 20 minutes to bike down there. On a blizzard day -- well, I just don't go on a blizzard day, even though my cells were screaming for me to check on them.

    Proximity matters, especially if you are an undergraduate trying to squeeze time for the lab. **Find a lab close to campus, your dorm or your classrooms.** These are heuristics that will help you become a better researcher.

5. Reputation  
   At the undergraduate level, the reputation of your PI doesn't really matter. The project you worked on and how much you learned is more important. However, to help you understand a bit, here are some common awards: 
   
    [HHMI](https://www.hhmi.org/)= Howard Hughes Medical Institue, very prestigious 7-year position with 8 million funding for professors.   
    [MacArthur Fellows](https://www.macfound.org/) = Fellowship for professors who have achieved a lot under 40   
    [National Academy of Arts and Sciences](https://www.amacad.org/)= Selected for their significant contribution in the field, prestigious 

    If you can find PI with these titles, great! But don't bother to hunt them down. They often operate big labs and have no time for little shrimp like you either.

# Common ways of finding a lab 

1. Through a class  
    This is how I was referred to do my senior thesis with Prof. Wagner, through a previous class with Prof. Stearns (see [reflection #1](https://tiger-pillow.github.io/post/reflection1/))

    Sometimes professors talk about their research in their class, and even ask for undergrads who are interested to work for them. Do well in those class, talk to them briefly after class, get an idea of their approach with undergrads.

    If you are referred, take the opportunity, because that means you are "recommended". The Prof. seeking referral often has some non-trivial project that they hope to get someone trustworthy to work on. 

2. Through a friend  
    If you heard about something cool over dinner, ask them on! What's better than discussing fun science with friends and working on experiments together? You can also walk to the lab together in a blizzard. 

    This is by no means a necessity though. You will soon find, that research, no matter how collaborative, are solitary by nature. Just a way to get in, not a way to success

3. Cold emailing  
    The most common approach, though not the best. 

4. Established Programs 
SURF at Mayo, Yale's STARS, more prestigious ones at Rockefeller
