If you are interested in doing research at the undergraduate level, read on! I had many pitfalls to write this guide for you. 

# My experience with different labs 
Disclaimer: I have nothing bad to say about the following professors (except Van Tessel perhaps). My experience /time spent in each lab doesn't even qualify me to judge in most cases. I left because incompatibility and my own personality -- see reflections later on. This is just to situate you in my path.

1. Malhorta lab (radiology)
I worked very briefly in the Malhorta lab at Yale New Haven Hospital (Radiology department), introduced by an upperclass student that I know. My direct mentor was a resident (bad sign), and the research very clinical and mathy. Nobody has time to mentor me, and I did primarily data collection. Left after 1 year. 

2. Van Tessel lab (chemical engineering)
Here I saw the worst facets of a Yale professor. Paul Van Tessel is tenured, with no research funding, no grad student or staff, and an abanonded lab. I didn't know this when I emailed him and agreed to work for him. The first time I visited, there was a golden retriver tethered to the bench. Other professors and postdocs apparently used his lab as a storage room. Left after a semester. 

3. Kyriakides lab (biomedical engineering)
Awesome professor, great people. I worked under a postdoc, who tauhgt me something. Prof. Kyriakides was incredibly accessible and hands-on. We did experiments together and analyzed histology slides together. Didn't get any meaningful results. Left in the end due to my gap year. 

4. Lerman lab (nephrology, Mayo Clinic)
Worked there for a summer, great people and great lab, mentored by the great Dr.Kai Jiang. Published a paper. 

5. Wagner lab (EEB, yale)
I was referred to his lab by EEB DUS Prof. Stearns, and with him I took a class and completed my senior thesis. I was mentored by the PI himself, who is so kind and intelligent. The topics I was interested in immensely, about the evolution of menstruation. I learned a lot. 

# How labs work in the U.S.
As a high school student coming into college, especially a college like Yale with a plethora of labs and professors, you will be awed, confused, and ovewhelmed. It's important to get an idea of how labs operate in the U.S., which will help you in finding the appropriate starting place and ensure a good experience. Here, I speak from my personal experience and understanding, mostly in the field of biology. Other fields likely work very differently (for example, econ or math).

Each lab has a PI, principle investigator, who is the boss. The PI overlooks the operation of the lab, and secures funding, which is argubly his or her most important task. Inside the lab, there are various posts similar to those of a food chain (not really): research scientists, post-docs, graduate students, lab technicians and assitants, rotating students, undergraduates, and sometimes in the summer, high school students. A lab can be as big as 50-80 people, or small of 2-3 people. Not all labs have all the positions, and the positions don't necessarily mean the same job.
