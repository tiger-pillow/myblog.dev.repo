Yesterday was the last day of my first year at EPFL, so I think I've gathered some observations to wrtie this article

#### General
Yale -- I did my bachelor's here. It is a private uni located New Haven, Connecticut, USA.  
EPFL -- Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne, I am doing my Master's here. It is a public uni located near Lausanne, Switzerland.

#### Tutition 


#### Demographics 
Yale -- Around ~ 4700 undergraduates (even less when I was there).  
EPFL -- Around ~ 6500 undergraduates.

Yale -- M/F ratio 1:1   
EPFL -- M/F ratio 7:3 

### Okay, the above information is to give you a general idea, now on to the more interesting parts.

#### Student Organizations

#### Work Mindset 


#### Culture 
I can't say too much about the culture here, because everyone inevitably lives in his/her own friends group and experiences a different subculture.
