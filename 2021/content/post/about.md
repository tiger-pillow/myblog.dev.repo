Hi, 

I am a senior at Yale majoring in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. I can still say this because I will graduate in two weeks, and it will feel a bit strange to not introduce myself as a student.


I am broadly interested in evolutionary biology and outdoors life (snowboarding/skiing, hiking, trail running, [figure skating](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av80437018/), badminton). I plan to attend Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne starting September 2021.
