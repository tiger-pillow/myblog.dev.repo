I am angry.
I am angry at you, my friend. 

You, white, priviledged, living your easy life in a developed country. 
You, going to university for the best education, 
reading your wikipedia and watching your youtube videos, 
complaining to me about your petty trifes, 
eating the hot lasagne that your mom cooked for you. 

You don't realize how goddamn lucky you are. You fucking don't deserve any of this. 

You don't understand the terror of living in an authoritarian country. 
that I haven't seen my parents in three years. 
that I don't have access to covid vaccines. 
that I might "disappear" if I left a wrong comment on the internet, 
that I will "evaporate" if I protest on the streets of Beijing, 
that I need to be extraordinary to escape this destiny, 
that I work so hard for an opportunity that you don't even care. 

Yes, you didn't cause any of this. 
Yes, you feel sorry for me. 

But please don't be so ignorant and just pretend you understand me. 
Because you fucking don't. 
Wake up, open your eyes, and read the news. 
You should be angry as I do.
