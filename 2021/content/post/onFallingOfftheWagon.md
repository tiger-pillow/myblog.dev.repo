I got "on the wagon" in August -- meaning that I've amped up my milage significantly, over 120 miles per month, and sometimes even over 100km per week. Two months have passed since then, and I have learned so much about my body, my own mental processes, time, dealing with expectations, past performances etc. 

I have a troubled relationship with running -- I used to run excessively to lose weight, borderline aneoric, had suicidal attempts due to the stress of my races. Since high school, I have worked on my relationship with running, and now it has got to a steady point. I start to enjoy it again, and start to set goals for myself. 

There are a few lessons I learned about sports that are quite different from other kinds of work. 

## Do not excessively reprimand yourself 
Often as distance-runners, we hold ourselves to high standards, and that's usually how we drag ourselves out of bed to run 20 miles on Sunday mornings. We are particularly harsh when we slacked off a little, walked in the middle, or stopped before target milage. 

What I learned recently is that as long as I generally follow the plan, there is no need to reprimand myself. Not running for a day or two will not affect my performance immediately -- in fact it might even help a little. What's worse is the time wasted on hesitating, regreting, feeling negative, depressed and anxious. 

Sometimes after a long day at school, I would come back home and sit in front of my desk and fuss over whether to run or not. I would spend an hour feeling anxious, not concentrating on my homework because I feel like "I should run", and not putting on my sneakers either. This is not productive. 

Be a bit easier on yourself is essential for your mental sanity. 

## Be rational 
It's helpful to analyze why exactly you don't feel like running. Once you analyzed the common scenarios, you can use strategies to cope with them. For example 
1. I just had a huge dinner 
   Often I run after dinner, and if I had a delicious 5-course meal, chances are that I feel too bloated to put on my sportsbra. Right now I am slowly switching my running to early morning -- the time when I feel the lightest, the freshest. 

2. I didn't sleep enough 
   This happens, and usually I feel really tired going into the run, but as I reach 3 mile or later, I feel much better. Running on sleep shortage will inevitably reflect later in the day though -- I take a nap in the afternoon. 

3. I didnt' do much intense intellectual work during the day 
   If I was just running errands the whole day, didn't read or worked with some intellectual intensity, I often don't feel like running. Running to me is a chance to clear up, to let go of my thoughts, give a break to my eyes. 

4. Stress
   Sometimes it's just the stress of life -- you have one hour and half to run a 10k, shower, and get ready for school. Should you go or not? 


## You will fall off the wagon -- just get back on, it's fine. 
This, in fact, I learned from CGP Grey --- the health journey, you will inevitably fall off the wagon. The key is to not give up, not hover over it too much, and just get back on. 

## No music is better 


## Know your training plan well and be prepared
