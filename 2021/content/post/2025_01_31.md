I was thinking, how much time do I have? 

24*7 =168 hours per week.   

I work 9-8 most days, including commute, sometimes a bit more. So that’s 55 hours. Sometimes I work on the weekends, sometimes I go home early, let's ignore those. 

I sleep and poop, in total, 8 hours per day, so that’s 56 hours. 

I do sports for at least 6 hours per week. Often this is during work hours. Let’s put it to 6, because showering, self care etc. 

I cook, clean, laundry, errands, etc. Let's put it at 5 hours. 

So I have 168 - 111 - 6 - 5 = 46 hours left. 

This really makes me think about, on what, how, with whom, do I want to spend my time. 

Also doing the tiktok challenge #nobuy2025. I need mental clarity. And physical clutter does not help in that regard.
