I have two finals left, yet I decide to write about my Yale experience. After all, what's better than procrastinating by reflecting? 

I majored in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) at Yale, graduating with 38.5 credits (requirement is 36).My GPA is around 3.82, which is around the top 30% cutoff among undergrads. I am by no means among "the bright" or "the hardworking" ones at Yale, and very much just a mediocre international student struggling on a day-to-day basis. 

However, I enjoyed 95% of my classes tremendously. The things I was introduced to in classrooms and some assignments I finished are my favorite parts of Yale (most other Yalies wouldn't rate the classes this high). Here I just want to share some of these. 

# Gladys' unsolicited advice on choosing courses 
1. Don't double major. 
2. Take small classes. 
3. Do not overload.
