I have two finals left, yet I decide to write about my Yale experience. After all, what's better than procrastinating by reflecting? 

I majored in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) at Yale, graduating with 38.5 credits (requirement is 36).  My GPA is around 3.82, which is around the top 30% cutoff among undergrads. I am by no means among "the bright" or "the hardworking" ones at Yale, and very much just a mediocre international student struggling on a day-to-day basis. 

However, I enjoyed 95% of my classes tremendously. The things I was introduced to in classrooms and some assignments I finished are my favorite parts of Yale (most  Yalies wouldn't rate their academic experience this high). Here I just want to share some of thoughts.

# Gladys' unsolicited advice on choosing courses 
1. Don't double major. 
2. Take small classes. 
3. Do not overload. 

# Best courses I've taken 
1. E&EB 380 Life History Evolution 
    <p>Taught by Prof. Stephen Stearns (who has since retired) <p>
    <p>Hands down the best class I've taken at Yale, and I feel incredibly fortunate and indebted to Yale because of it. I ran into this class by accident, was the only student in the class, and subsequently changed my major because of it.<p>
    <p>Life History Evolution sounds like the vaguest title you can find. My high school physics teacher once said "the value and depth of a course are inversely proportional to the grandness of its name," which I believed firmly (true in most circumstances). However, this course's title defies this rule.<p>
    <p>Life History is a small branch of evolutionary biology. It studies events related to survival and reproduction of an organism. Some questiosn that it attempts to answer are: why do humans only have one baby when mice often can have dozens? Why isn't cancer eliminated by selection if it kills people? Does Covid-19 put evolutionary pressure on the population? <p>
