My writing frequency is inversely proportional to how good life has been to me. May was really good, and I am grateful. 

April was difficult because of injuries and health issues. Sitting at home during Easter break, injured, sick, tired and bored, I realized that I needed to make some changes. And the thing about life is that the moment you made the resolution to change, it starts to respond to your will. I resumed cycling, been trying to go on more dates, meet new people, hang out with old friends. Things seem to be going in the right direction. 

Work has been very interesting although a bit tiring. Constant news influx was making everyone on the line, pushing everyone over the edge, and now there is no man left standing. I had a few episodes of disagreement with my boss, but I am learning a lot from each. 

Another new development is: saying yes to things. Shonda Rhimes had this book called "Year of Yes". I couldn't stand its writing style, but the message is very much passed on to me. The only way to get over something, is to be more exposed to it. Saying yes to events, to parties, to meeting new people, to trying new sports. 

Not much else to say.
