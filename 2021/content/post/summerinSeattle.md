August has been busy -- hosting friends, solo backpacking, flying to NYC on a whim, clearing out my belongings  -- and amid all these, inevitably, summer has come to an end. Two days later I will leave the country that has welcomed me for the past five years, maybe for a couple of years, maybe for forever.

Often, I feel like my life is a little too dazzling. 2016-2021 are undoubtedly the craziest years of my life so far. I've been to so many places: Tokyo, Paris, Lausanne, Geneva, Chamonix, Amsterdam, Siem Reap, Kuala Lumpur, Salt Lake City .... I've met so many wonderful people: Z, J, TC, J, C, C, C, Z... Some of these journeys are because of courses, research, internships, some just because I am extremely priviledged and I decided to go. My life is the opposite of "the average adult life", whose "daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us," as captured by Wallace.
