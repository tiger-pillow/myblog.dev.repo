# to be updated, will review the 9 resorts i've been to this winter 

1. Winter Park/ Mary Jane 
   Best tree runs! Practically skiable everywhere, good food, and Eagle Wind if you got lucky. 

2. Snowbird 
   Steep, Scary but So Much Fun! 

3. Aspen Highlands
   Personally I love hard workouts, and nothing beats the hike up Highland bowl. Awesome trees, that chair was slow though.

4. Aspen Snowmass 
   Huge, family-friendly (what's better than watching little kiddos on the chairlift?)
   Hit up Coffee Pot trail, it's scenic

5. Solitude 
   Undervalued, scary, steep, loads of cliff, amazing on a good day. 
   However, it's IKON unlimited, so expect crowds 

6. A-basin 
   Some extreme double blacks (oh so much fun) and back bowl skiing.
   My phone has absolutely 0 signal there -- scary. I mean I can't even make a phone call. What if I need the patrols? 

7. Brighton 
   Good park if you are into that stuff. Trails a bit too flat (forever pain of a snowboarder)
   Terrible traffic though. Once on a blizzard day, I spent 2 hours from one end of the lot to another end. 

8. Stevens Pass 
   Visited with friends late April, PNW spring powder didn't disappoint. 
   Trails boring though. 

9. Copper Mountain 
   Small section of good double blacks, fun for a day or two. Great park if you are into that. 
   Huge crowds though, also the chairlifts are so short, so you have to transit multiple times to get anywhere. 

10. Aspen Mountain 
    Decent blacks. Terrible chairlift design. Every run includes some ridiculously long and painful traverse. 
    Close to town if you fancy a beer or two. 

11. Buttermilk 
    Good park (ofc it holds the X-games every year). I am not good enough to enjoy it yet. 
    The Kardashians sometimes come here if you are interested in those stuff. 

12. Eldora 
    If I haven't been to any of the above, this wouldn't be too bad. But once you have seen, you cannot unsee.
