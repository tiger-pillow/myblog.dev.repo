# Snowboarded for 50 days this season. Wish I could say this every year. Here are the reviews! 

1. Winter Park/ Mary Jane ![Winter Park/Mary Jane](/post/resorts/WinterPark.jpg "Winter Park") 
   <p> Best tree runs! Practically skiable everywhere, good food, and Eagle Wind if you got lucky. <p>

2. Snowbird ![Snowbird](/post/resorts/Snowbird.png "Snowbird") 
    <p>Steep, Scary but So Much Fun! <p>

3. [Aspen Highlands](/post/resorts/AspenHighland.png)
   <p>Personally I love hard workouts, and nothing beats the hike up Highland bowl. Awesome trees, that chair was slow though.<p>

4. Aspen Snowmass 
   
   Huge, family-friendly (what's better than watching little [kiddos](/post/resorts/Kiddo.jpeg) on the chairlift?) <p>
   Hit up [Coffee Pot trail](/post/resorts/Snowmass.png), it's scenic. <p>

5. Solitude![Solitude](/post/resorts/Solitude.png) 
   <p>Underappreciated, scary, steep, loads of cliff, amazing on a good day.
   However, it's IKON unlimited, so expect crowds. <p>

6. [A-basin](/post/resorts/Abasin.png "Arapahoe Basin") 
   <p>Some extreme double blacks (oh so much fun) and back bowl skiing.
   My phone has absolutely 0 signal there -- not ideal. I can't even make a phone call. What if I need the patrols? <p>

7. [Brighton](/post/resorts/Brighton.png) 
   <p>Good park if you are into that stuff. Trails a bit too flat (forever pain of a snowboarder).<p>
   Terrible traffic though. Once on a blizzard day, I spent 2 hours from one end of the parking lot to another end. <p>

8. [Stevens Pass](/post/resorts/StevensPass.png)
   <p>Visited with friends late April, PNW spring powder didn't disappoint. 
   Trails boring though. <p>

9. [Copper Mountain](/post/resorts/CopperMountain.png)
   <p>Small section of good double blacks, fun for a day or two. Great park if you are into that. 
   Huge crowds though, also the chairlifts are so short, so you have to transit multiple times to get anywhere. <p>

10. Aspen Mountain 
    <p>Decent blacks. Terrible chairlift design. Every run includes some ridiculously long and painful traverse. 
    Close to town if you fancy a beer or two. <p>

11. [Buttermilk](/post/resorts/Buttermilk.png)
    <p>Good park (ofc it holds the X-games every year). I am not good enough to enjoy it yet. <p>
    The Kardashians sometimes come here if you are interested in those stuff. <p>

12. Eldora 
    <p>If I haven't been to any of the above, this wouldn't be too bad. But once you have seen, you cannot unsee. <p>


Voila! I am grateful for this chance to snowboard so much this season. There are still half a dozen resorts left on my bucket list, but 来日方长 as we say in Chinese (the coming days would be long). Cheers to the adventures ahead!
