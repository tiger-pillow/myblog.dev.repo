On my hike near Chamonix in France, I sat down at a communal dinner with two Swiss gentleman, both are professional violinist living in Interlaken. After they learned that I go to school at Yale, one said: 

"Oh, Yale has a fantastic school of music!"  
"I guess yeah," I nodded hesitantly, not knowing for sure where YSM stands.   
"So do you play for the Yale orchestra?" they asked. 
"ah no" I said, my voice getting smaller.
"What instrument do you play?"
