Two thoughts.

One. 

In the latest TBOY podcast, the host mentioned how "single child"s are often better at entertaining themselves, and often more independent. When they cannot figure out a problem, whether that's study abroad, job search, romantic love, finding apartments, moving, etc, they cannot turn to siblings for an easy ask. Parents aren't always available, so they figure out ways to entertain themselves. Because they can solve most problems by themselves, they turn to assume the same level of competency of others.   

That's so true. How come I never think of it that way?     

I almost never feel lonely in my life. If anything I often find most people's accompany boring. A good book, a quality film, a project of one's own, to me are often more enjoyable than a mediocre conversation. I used to think there is something wrong with me. But now I realize perhaps that's just part of the perks of growing up a single child.    

Two.    

There is no such thing called "I don't have time for a relationship". The better way to say it is "I don't like you enough to give you that kind of priority in my life now". If you like this person enough, you'd make it work, whatever it takes.   

It's so harsh, but that's precisely because it's the truth that nobody says out loud. Too much euphemism floating around.
