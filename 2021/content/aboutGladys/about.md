Hi, 

I am Gladys. 

I am interested in Evolutionry Biology. I graduated from Yale College in 2021. 
I will be attending Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne in September 2021. 

Some other things that I do include: snowboarding/skiing, guitar, hiking, trail running, [figure skating](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av80437018/), badminton. I code, take some photos and write a bit.
